Imagine having an interpretable model such as linear regression or decision trees, but an explanation that looks at hundreds or thousands of variables, it would be really hard for any human to digest that explanation!\n",

As such, when *an explanation is consistent with the prior beliefs of an individual*, they tend to favor such explanation ( also known as **confirmation bias**). This is not to discredit any novel or serendipitous discoveries of the model explanation. However, having an explanation that is in line with a domain expert, helps in the model's adoption.

When using Shapley values to explain machine learning models, we define the **gain** as the **outcome of the model** for a *single observation* and the **players** as **feature values** of that observation. A **coalition** would then correspond to a subset of feature values used in prediction. Thus, the obtained **Shapley values** would correspond to the **expected marginal contribution** of the feature value to the model's prediction.
